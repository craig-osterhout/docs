Docker imposes limits for Docker Hub to ensure fair resource consumption and
maintain service quality. Understanding your usage and limits helps you manage
your usage effectively.

## Overview of limits

The following table provides an overview of the limits for each user type,
subject to fair use:

| User type                              | Pull rate limit per hour               | Number of public repositories | Number of private repositories |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Pro, Team, or Business (authenticated) | Unlimited                              | Unlimited                     | Unlimited                      |
| Personal (authenticated)               | 100                                    | Unlimited                     | Up to 1                        |
| Unauthenticated users                  | 10 per IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 subnet | Not applicable                | Not applicable                 |

## Fair use

When utilizing the Docker Platform, users should be aware that excessive data
transfer, pull rates, or data storage can lead to throttling, or additional
charges. To ensure fair resource usage and maintain service quality, we reserve
the right to impose restrictions or apply additional charges to accounts
exhibiting excessive data and storage consumption.

### Abuse rate limit

Docker Hub has an abuse rate limit to protect the application and
infrastructure. This limit applies to all requests to Hub properties including
web pages, APIs, and image pulls. The limit is applied per IPv4 address or per
IPv6 /64 subnet, and while the limit changes over time depending on load and
other factors, it's in the order of thousands of requests per minute. The abuse
limit applies to all users equally regardless of account level.

You can differentiate between the pull rate limit and abuse rate limit by
looking at the error code. The abuse limit returns a simple `429 Too Many
Requests` response. The pull limit returns a longer error message that includes
a link to documentation.

## Understand pulls

The follow sections define a pull and how it is attributed.

### Pull definition

A pull is defined as the following:

 - A Docker pull includes both a version check and any download that
   occurs as a result of the pull. Depending on the client, a `docker pull` can
   verify the existence of an image or tag without downloading it by performing
   a version check.
 - Version checks do not count towards usage pricing.
 - A pull for a normal image makes one pull for a [single
   manifest](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/main/manifest.md).
 - A pull for a multi-arch image will count as one pull for each
   different architecture.

### Pull attribution

Pulls from authenticated users can be attributed to either a personal or an
organization
[namespace](/reference/glossary/#organization-name).

Attribution is based on the following:

- Private pulls: Pulls for private repositories are attributed to the
  repository's namespace owner.
- Public pulls: When pulling images from a public repository, attribution is
  determined based on domain affiliation and organization membership.
- Verified domain ownership: When pulling an image from an account linked to a
  verified domain, the attribution is set to be the owner of that
  [domain](/manuals/security/faqs/single-sign-on/domain-faqs.md).
- Single organization membership:
   - If the owner of the verified domain is a company and the user is part of
     only one organization within that
     [company](/manuals/admin/faqs/company-faqs.md#what-features-are-supported-at-the-company-level),
     the pull is attributed to that specific organization.
   - If the user is part of only one organization, the pull is attributed to
     that specific organization.
- Multiple organization memberships: If the user is part of multiple
  organizations under the company, the pull is attributed to the user's personal
  namespace.

When pulling Docker Verified Publisher images, attribution towards rate limiting
is not applied. For more details, see [Docker Verified Publisher
Program](/manuals/docker-hub/repos/manage/trusted-content/dvp-program.md).

#### Authenticate for pull attribution

To attribute your pulls to you user account, you must authenticate with Docker
Hub. The following sections provide information on how to sign in to Docker Hub
to authenticate your pulls.

##### Docker Desktop

If you are using Docker Desktop, you can sign in to Docker Hub from the Docker
Desktop menu.

Select **Sign in / Create Docker ID** from the Docker Desktop menu and follow
the on-screen instructions to complete the sign-in process.

##### Docker Engine

If you're using a standalone version of Docker Engine, run the `docker login`
command from a terminal to authenticate with Docker Hub. For information on how
to use the command, see [docker login](/reference/cli/docker/login.md).

##### Docker Swarm

If you're running Docker Swarm, you must use the `--with-registry-auth` flag to
authenticate with Docker Hub. For more information, see [Create a
service](/reference/cli/docker/service/create.md#with-registry-auth). If you
are using a Docker Compose file to deploy an application stack, see [docker
stack deploy](/reference/cli/docker/stack/deploy.md).

##### GitHub Actions

If you're using GitHub Actions to build and push Docker images to Docker Hub,
see [login action](https://github.com/docker/login-action#dockerhub). If you are
using another Action, you must add your username and access token in a similar
way for authentication.

##### Kubernetes

If you're running Kubernetes, follow the instructions in [Pull an Image from a
Private
Registry](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/)
for information on authentication.

##### Third-party platforms

If you're using any third-party platforms, follow your providerâ€™s instructions on using registry authentication.

> [!NOTE]
>
> When pulling images via a third-party platform, the platform may use the same
> IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 subnet to pull images for multiple users. Even if you
> are authenticated, pulls attributed to a single IPv4 address or IPv6 /64 subnet
> may cause [abuse rate limiting](./_index.md#abuse-rate-limit).

## Monitor usage

Learn how to monitor your usage in the following sections.

### View pull rate and limit

Rate limits apply to image pulls by unauthenticated and Docker Personal users.
There is no pull rate limit for users or automated systems with a paid
subscription.

When you issue a pull and you are over the limit, Docker Hub returns a
`429` response code with the following body when the manifest is requested:

```text
You have reached your pull rate limit. You may increase the limit by authenticating and upgrading: https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits
```

This error message appears in the Docker CLI or in the Docker Engine logs.

To view your current pull rate and limit:

> [!NOTE]
>
> To check your limits, you need `curl`, `grep`, and `jq` installed.

1. Get a token.

   - To get a token anonymously, if you are pulling anonymously:

      ```console
      $ TOKEN=$(curl "https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:ratelimitpreview/test:pull" | jq -r .token)
      ```

   - To get a token with a user account, if you are authenticated (insert your
     username and password in the following command):

      ```console
      $ TOKEN=$(curl --user 'username:password' "https://auth.docker.io/token?service=registry.docker.io&scope=repository:ratelimitpreview/test:pull" | jq -r .token)
      ```

2. Get the headers that contain your limits. These headers are returned on both
   GET and HEAD requests. Using GET emulates a real pull and counts towards the
   limit. Using HEAD won't.


   ```console
   $ curl --head -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://registry-1.docker.io/v2/ratelimitpreview/test/manifests/latest
   ```

3. Examine the headers. You should see the following headers.

   ```text
   ratelimit-limit: 100;w=21600
   ratelimit-remaining: 76;w=21600
   docker-ratelimit-source: 192.0.2.1
   ```

   In the previous example, the pull limit is 100 pulls per 21600 seconds (6
   hours), and there are 76 pulls remaining.

   If you don't see any `ratelimit` header, it could be because the image or your IP
   is unlimited in partnership with a publisher, provider, or an open source
   organization. It could also mean that the user you are pulling as is part of a
   paid Docker plan. Pulling that image won't count toward pull rate limits if you
   don't see these headers.

### View monthly usage

For authenticated users, you can view your usage on the [Usage
page](https://hub.docker.com/usage/pulls) in Docker Hub.

On the **Pulls** tab, you can also send a report to your email that contains a comma
separated file with the following detailed information.

| CSV column           | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Usage guidance                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `datehour`           | The date and hour (`yyyy/mm/dd/hh`) of the pull that resulted in the data transfer.                                                                                                                                | This helps in identifying peak usage times and patterns.                                                                                                                            |
| `user_name`          | The Docker ID of the user that pulled the image                                                                                                                                                                    | This lets organization owners track data consumption per user and manage resources effectively.                                                                                     |
| `repository`         | The name of the repository of the image that was pulled.                                                                                                                                                           | This lets you identify which repositories are most frequently accessed and consume most of the data transfer.                                                                       |
| `access_token_name`  | Name of the access token that was used for authentication with Docker CLI. `generated` tokens are automatically generated by the Docker client when a user signs in.                                               | Personal access tokens are usually used to authenticate automated tools (Docker Desktop, CI/CD tools, etc.). This is useful for identifying which automated system issued the pull. |
| `ips`                | The IP address that was used to pull the image. This field is aggregated, so more than one IP address may appear, representing all the IPs used to pull an image within the same date and hour.                    | This helps you understand the origin of the data transfer, which is useful for diagnosing and identifying patterns in automated or manual pulls.                                    |
| `repository_privacy` | The privacy state of the image repository that was pulled. This can either be `public` or `private`.                                                                                                               | This distinguishes between public and private repositories to identify which data transfer threshold the pull impacts.                                                              |
| `tag`                | The tag for the image. The tag is only available if the pull included a tag.                                                                                                                                       | This helps in identifying the image. Tags are often used to identify specific versions or variants of an image.                                                                     |
| `digest`             | The unique image digest for the image.                                                                                                                                                                             | This helps in identifying the image.                                                                                                                                                |
| `version_checks`     | The number of version checks accumulated for the date and hour of each image repository. Depending on the client, a pull can do a version check to verify the existence of an image or tag without downloading it. | This helps identify the frequency of version checks, which you can use to analyze usage trends and potential unexpected behaviors.                                                  |
| `pulls`              | The number of pulls accumulated for the date and hour of each image repository.                                                                                                                                            | This helps identify the frequency of repository pulls, which you can use to analyze usage trends and potential unexpected behaviors. |

## Optimize usage

Use the following steps to help optimize and manage your Docker Hub usage for
both individuals and organizations:

1. [View your Docker Hub usage](https://hub.docker.com/usage).

2. Use the Docker Hub usage data to identify which accounts consume the most
   data, determine peak usage times, and identify which images are related to
   the most data usage. In addition, look for usage trends, such as the
   following:

   - Inefficient pull behavior: Identify frequently accessed repositories to
     assess whether you can optimize caching practices or consolidate usage to
     reduce pulls.
   - Inefficient automated systems: Check which automated tools, such as CI/CD
     pipelines, may be causing higher pull rates, and configure them to avoid
     unnecessary image pulls.

3. Optimize image pulls by:

   - Using caching: Implement local image caching via
     [mirroring](/docker-hub/mirror/) or within your CI/CD pipelines to reduce
     redundant pulls.
   - Automating manual workflows: Avoid unnecessary pulls by configuring automated
     systems to pull only when a new version of an image is available.

4. Optimize your storage by:

    - Regularly auditing and [removing entire repositories](/manuals/docker-hub/repos/delete.md) with untagged, unused, or outdated images.
    - Using [Image Management](/manuals/docker-hub/repos/manage/hub-images/manage.md) to remove stale and outdated images within a repository.

5. For organizations, monitor and enforce organizational policies by doing the
   following:

   - Routinely [view Docker Hub usage](https://hub.docker.com/usage) to monitor usage.
   - [Enforce sign-in](/security/for-admins/enforce-sign-in/) to ensure that you
     can monitor the usage of your users and users receive higher usage limits.
   - Look for duplicate user accounts in Docker and remove accounts from your organization
   as needed.
